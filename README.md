Chopper
============

Field destroying for java objects that delete references to and dispose/close object which uses annotation processing to generate boilerplate
code for you.

```java
class ExampleActivity extends Activity {
  @Chopper() 
  SomeObject someObject;

  @Chopper() 
  SomeOtherObject someOtherObject;
  
  @Override
  protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    Chopper.chopp(this);
  }
}
```
